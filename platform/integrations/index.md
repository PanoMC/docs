# Game Integrations

Pano supports seamless integration with various game plugins to enhance your Pano experience. These integrations work in a **plug-and-play** manner — when configured properly, they automatically connect and synchronize with your Minecraft server.

## 🔌 Pano MC Plugin

All game integrations require the **Pano MC Plugin** to be installed and connected to your Pano instance. The Pano MC Plugin acts as a bridge between your Minecraft server and Pano, enabling real-time communication and data synchronization.

**Key Features:**

- 🔒 **End-to-End Encryption** — Secure WebSocket communication using RSA + AES-256 hybrid encryption
- 🔄 **Real-Time Sync** — Instant player data synchronization between game and web
- 🎮 **Multi-Platform Support** — Works with Spigot, Paper, Folia, Bungeecord, and Velocity
- 🧩 **Plugin Hooks** — Automatically detects and hooks into supported plugins (AuthMe, permissions, etc.)
- 📡 **Event System** — Listens to in-game events and sends them to Pano
- ⚙️ **Auto-Configuration** — Automatically adjusts plugin settings for compatibility

> ⚠️ **Important:** Always use the **latest version** of the Pano MC Plugin to ensure compatibility with all integrations and latest features.

## 📋 Available Integrations

### Authentication & Player Management

- [**AuthMeReloaded**](./authme/) — Seamless authentication system integration

## 🎯 How Integrations Work

Pano's integrations are designed to work **seamlessly** with supported plugins:

1. **Install** the supported plugin on your Minecraft server (Spigot/Paper/Folia)
2. **Connect** your Minecraft server to Pano using the [Pano MC Plugin](../installation/) (via **Servers** tab → **+** button in the panel)
3. **Verify** the integration is enabled from **Panel → Server Settings → Game Integration** (most integrations are enabled by default)
4. That's it! Pano will automatically detect and hook into the plugin

## 🔌 Integration Features

When an integration is active, Pano can:

- ✅ Synchronize player data between game and web
- ✅ Handle authentication flows (login, register, password management)
- ✅ Execute plugin commands from the panel
- ✅ Listen to plugin events and react accordingly
- ✅ Automatically configure plugin settings for optimal compatibility

## 🚀 Coming Soon

We're constantly working to add more integrations. Some plugins we're considering:

- **Permission Plugins** (LuckPerms, etc.)
- **Ban Management Plugins**
