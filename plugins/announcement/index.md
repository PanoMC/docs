# Announcement Plugin

The **Announcement** plugin is a powerful tool for broadcasting information to your community. It supports two main display types: **Banners** and **Modals**, each with its own set of features and customization options.

## 📢 Display Types

### 1. Banner
Banners appear at the top of your website and are ideal for quick updates or persistent notices.
- **Multiple Contents:** You can add multiple content tabs to a single banner.
- **Effects:** Choose from `NONE`, `MARQUEE` (scrolling text), and `FLASH`.
- **Custom Styles:** Select from various color schemes (`PRIMARY`, `SUCCESS`, `DANGER`, `WARNING`, etc.).
- **Alignment:** Align your text `LEFT`, `CENTER`, or `RIGHT`.
- **Location:** Display the banner `GLOBAL` (all pages) or only on the `HOME` page.
- **Dismissible:** Optionally allow users to close the banner.

### 2. Modal
Modals are pop-up windows that grab the user's attention immediately.
- **Rich Content:** full support for HTML and rich text via the built-in editor.
- **Image Support:** Upload banners or promotional images (up to 2MB).
- **Sizes:** Choose from `SMALL`, `NORMAL`, `LARGE`, or `FULL` screen.
- **Frequency:** Show the modal to users `ALWAYS` or only `ONCE` per session.

## 🗓️ Scheduling & Visibility
- **Status Management:** Toggle between `ACTIVE` and `DRAFT` modes.
- **Delayed Opening:** Use the **Show From** feature to schedule an announcement for a future date.
- **Auto-Expiration:** Set a **Timed** expiration to automatically hide the announcement when it's no longer relevant.

## 🎨 Advanced Customization
- **Custom CSS:** Every announcement has its own CSS section. Use the unique ID selector (e.g., `#pano-announcement-5`) to apply custom styles directly.
- **Call-to-Action:** Add internal or external links to your announcements, with an option to open in a new tab.

## 🛡️ Required Permission
To manage announcements, users must have the following permission:
`pano.plugin.pano-plugin-announcement.manage.announcements`
